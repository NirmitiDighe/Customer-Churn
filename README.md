# Customer-Churn
Bank Customer Churn Analysis

Proposed data – The data contains details of different banking customers with their customer id, salary, credit score etc. 
Here with this data, we will be determining a bank customer churn and satisfaction which makes us analyze the customer 
behavior while banking. This analysis is important since retaining the customers serves to be cost effective than gaining 
new customers. Retention of the long users of the banking facility showcases that the bank has a long-time trust which can 
make them attract more customers. Predictor variables such as credit score can help in determining the churning with tenure 
and balance determining the customer’s relationship with the banking services.

Description – The dataset contains 10,000 observations with 18 variables. Variables include customer id, surname, credit 
score, balance, number of products, card type, points ear_ned etc. One of the key response variables can be the Exited 
variable to determine the customer churn. The response variable can vary based on different questions that the dataset 
answers. 

Questions – 
1. How does a customer churn vary based on the details of the customers such as credit score, balance etc? 
2. Which features are strongest indicators of customer churn? 
3. Factors that can help in retaining the customers and reducing the churn.  
4. How do different predictive models perform in predicting the churn? 

Analysis Plan – 
1. Data cleaning handing the missing values and omitting data which is not required for the analysis. 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis to visualize the churn rates and other observations. 
3. If required, split the data into training and testing sets.  
4. Perform appropriate analysis using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.  
5. Training multiple models and predicting its performance and performing cross-validation. 
6. Validating the model using the testing dataset to know the performance of the model.
